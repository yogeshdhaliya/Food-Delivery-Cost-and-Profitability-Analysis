# Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview

Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis is a comprehensive examination of the costs associated with delivering food orders and the overall profitability of a food delivery service. This analysis involves studying direct expenses such as delivery fees, packaging, and indirect costs including discounts and commission fees. The primary goal is to provide insights into the profitability of the service on a per-order basis, enabling businesses to optimize their strategies.

## Project Process

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.
   - Utilize a dataset that includes information such as order IDs, customer IDs, restaurant IDs, order dates, and various financial metrics.
   - Dataset used: [Food Delivery Dataset](link_to_dataset)

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
   - Convert date and time columns to datetime format.
   - Extract and calculate relevant features such as discount percentages and amounts.

3. **Cost and Profitability Analysis:**
   - Calculate total costs associated with each order, including delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discounts.
   - Determine revenue generated from each order, primarily through commission fees.
   - Calculate profits by subtracting total costs from revenue.
   - Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Plot a histogram of profits per order to visualize the distribution.
   - Create a pie chart to illustrate the proportion of total costs, breaking down delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discounts.
   - Generate a bar chart to compare total revenue, total costs, and total profit.

5. **New Strategy for Profits:**
   - Identify a new average commission percentage and discount percentage based on profitable orders.
   - Propose adjustments to commission and discount rates to improve overall profitability.

6. **Simulation:**
   - Simulate profitability with recommended discount and commission percentages.
   - Visualize the comparison of actual versus simulated profitability distributions.

## Project Results

- The analysis revealed that the total costs exceeded the total revenue, resulting in a net loss.
- Recommendations include adjusting commission rates closer to 30% and discount rates around 6% to improve profitability.
- Simulated scenarios indicate a potential shift towards higher profitability with the recommended adjustments.
